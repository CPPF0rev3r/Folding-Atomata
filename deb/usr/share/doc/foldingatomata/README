Third-party Folding@home 3D Viewer

Folding Atomata, like FAHViewer, allows you to visualize protein folding 
simulations and monitor the status of the simulation work units as they 
run on your computer. This program is a drop-in replacement for FAHViewer,
but shows additional details and views of the proteins that aren't
visible with FAHViewer.
