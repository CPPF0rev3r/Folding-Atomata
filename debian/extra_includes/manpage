.SH DESCRIPTION
Folding@home is a distributed computing project that uses the spare resources of volunteered computers for disease research.

This package contains Folding Atomata, a 3D simulation viewer. It connects to the local FAHClient instance to visualize the running simulations.

.SH OPTIONS
Folding Atomata supports many of FAHViewer's flags and command-line arguments. This allows it to be a near drop-in replacement for FAHViewer. Most notably, Atomata can connect to remote FAHClient instances and view their proteins.

The following options can be specified on the command line using the following syntax:
    --<option> <value>
  or:
    --<option>=<value>
  or when marking boolean values true:
    --<option>

\fB --connect \fR or \fB -c \fR
        An address/host and port to connect to. By default Atomata connects to 127.0.0.1:36330.
        Examples: --connect=127.0.0.1:36330 or -c 127.0.0.1:36330

\fB --help \fR or \fB -h \fR
        Prints usage format and available flags, and then quits.

\fB --license \fR
        Prints license information and quit.

\fB --password \fR or \fB -p \fR
        A password for accessing the remote client. Note that this is sent in plaintext.
        Examples: --password=myPassword or -p myPassword

\fB --version \fR
        Print version and quit.
