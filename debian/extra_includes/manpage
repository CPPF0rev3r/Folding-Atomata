.SH NAME
FoldingAtomata \- third-party 3D simulation viewer for Folding@home

.SH SYNOPSIS
FoldingAtomata - this command launches the application. A shortcut is also available under Menu => Education.

.SH DESCRIPTION
Folding@home is a distributed computing project that uses the spare resources of volunteered computers for disease research.

This package contains Folding Atomata, a 3D simulation viewer. It connects to the local FAHClient instance to visualize the running simulations.

.SH OPTIONS
No options at the moment. I am planning on supporting all of FAHViewer's flags and command-line options. This would allow Atomata to become a drop-in replacement for FAHViewer. Please watch https://github.com/Jesse-V/Folding-Atomata/issues/14 for more updates on this.
